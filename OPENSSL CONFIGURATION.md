# OPENSSL Configuration 

## Overview 
OpenSSL is the world’s most widely used implementation of the Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol. At the core, it’s also a robust and a high-performing cryptographic library with support for a wide range of cryptographic primitives.

OpenSSL is a de facto standard in this space and comes with a long history. 
Today, OpenSSL is ubiquitous on the server side and in many client programs. 
The command-line tools are also the most common choice for key and certificate management.
